This project is a two-player stone distribution game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed around a 14-cell circular grid where each cell initially holds seven stones. Players take turns selecting a box from their respective side, and its stones are distributed one by one into the following cells in sequence. If the last stone lands in a non-empty cell, its contents are picked up and redistributed; if the next cell is empty, the player scores based on upcoming non-empty boxes. The game features intelligent turn handling, score tracking, and dynamic gameplay logic. Additionally, smooth animations and visual transitions enhance the player experience, with real-time updates to the grid and scores, creating an engaging and interactive interface.
